Hello, I'm Peter Loyd.

This is not a good place to learn about my code. I haven't bothered to ✨polish✨ for resume purposes yet, and I'm fresh out of school.

Never the less to indicate my interests I've left public three projects I would like to continue:

- Chromophagi was my first independent project. A cellular automata-based biologic/chaotic image processor, it answers the question "what if we let color eating bacteria colonies loose on our photos?"
- A-Star-Is-Born (see organizations) was an exploration of some parallel A-Star search algorithms.
- SVPA_flooding_alert is a code-husk from when I put together a discord bot to monitor Snoqualmie Valley rivers for flooding. Eventually I'd like to re-do it and hook it up to rainfall inputs and an ML model.

Currently getting industry experience, but open to small fun projects, especially concerning distributed systems, simple ML, Images/Art, small games.

Thanks for visiting!
