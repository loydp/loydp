Hello, I'm Peter Loyd.

I love observing and processing information about the world. Earlier in my life that meant visual arts, now it means CS. If you want to collaborate I'm open to small fun projects, especially concerning distributed systems, simple ML, Images/Art, small games.

My work on here is generally not ✨polished✨ for public attention, as most of my git uploads are for work.

Thanks for visiting!
