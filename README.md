Hello, I'm Peter Loyd.

This is not a good place to learn about me. Most of my work so far has been as a student, and I haven't bothered to ✨polish✨ for resume purposes yet.

Never-the-less I've left a few things to indicate some of my interests. Three projects I would like to continue:

- Chromophagi was my first independent project. A cellular automata-based biologic/chaotic image processor, it answers the question "what if we let color eating bacteria colonies loose on our photos?"
- A-Star-Is-Born (see organizations) was an exploration of some parallel A-Star search algorithms.
- SVPA_flooding_alert is a husk from when I put together a discord bot to monitor Snoqualmie Valley rivers for flooding. Eventually I'd like to hook it up to rainfall and an ML model.

Currently getting industry experience, but open to small fun projects, especially concerning distributed systems, simple ML, Images/Art, small games.

Thanks for visiting!
