Hello, I'm Peter Loyd.

I love observing and processing information about the world. Earlier in my life that meant visual arts, now it means CS.

This is not a place to look at ✨polished✨ work, but I have left three projects public that I'd like to continue.

- Chromaphagi was my first independent project. A cellular automata-based biologic/chaotic image processor, it answers the question "what if we let color eating bacteria colonies loose on our photos?". Originally written in Java, then C++, I'm rewriting it in python to use openCV and for practice.
- A-Star-Is-Born (see organizations) was an exploration of some parallel A-Star search algorithms.
- SVPA_flooding_alert is my next project. It's a Snowqualmie Valley flood level monitoring and prediction bot. Originally written for a robotics club project that never stuck the landing, I'm planning on using weather/river data to try out various ML techniques.

I'm open to small fun projects, especially concerning distributed systems, simple ML, Images/Art, small games.

Thanks for visiting!
